# ABOUT US

## My Story
<p>
Iâ€™ve had issues with procrastination for many years and have had varying degrees of success with peer-to-peer accountability. It works very well for some and not for others. The issues I found were: 
<p>
- Finding someone who thinks along similar lines that I do 
- Finding someone who has comparable goals
- Is committed to the process long term
- Who Stays on topic 
- Stays on schedule (some people just want to talk)
- Remembers what was important to me (as people are naturally most concerned with their own goals.

So my goal is to deliver a service to help people achieve their goals and do so while leading a healthy life. My vision is to connect with like minded people and add value to the world by improving their effectiveness in it.
